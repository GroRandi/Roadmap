# Simplero Roadmap

This is the place to see what we're planning for the future, and to suggest new features, as well as to vote on them, comment on them, and petition for them.

We won't guarantee that everything listed or suggested here will see the light of day, or when features will be released, but we do very much want your input on where we're going, and what would be valuable to you.

For the planned features list, go to Issues.

Thank you so much for being a part of the family.

Love,  
â€“Calvin & the rest of the Simplero team

PS: if you're having troubling using GitHub, we have [a quick guide for you to follow](https://help.simplero.com/categories/274166-creating-github-and-submitting-a-feature)


## Submission guidelines

To make feature requests managable for us, and easily browsable for everyone else to participate in the discussion around individual request, we'd love it if you'd follow these guidelines:

1. Use a descriptive headline for the request. Make it easy for people to scan through the list of requests and see if they have the same request.
2. Provide a thorough description. Usually, a headline for the request is not enough for others to understand what you mean, so please provide a complete description of what you'd like to see and how you think it should behave, including references to sources of inspiration if possible. While we love videos for further inspiration or details, it's hard for us and other request submitters to scan through videos, so please do not submit a video in lieu of a full description, but provide the description along with the video.
3. One request per request. While you might have multiple requests, we'd want to be able to have a conversation about each of them without being confused, and to be able to make a decision on a request without it being confused with other requests. Therefore, make sure you submit only one request per Issue in here.

Thank you for taking part in the development of Simplero!
