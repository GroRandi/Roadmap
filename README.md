# Simplero Roadmap

This is the place to see what we're planning for the future, and to suggest new features, as well as to vote on them, comment on them, and petition for them.

We won't guarantee that everything listed or suggested here will see the light of day, or when features will be released, but we do very much want your input on where we're going, and what would be valuable to you.

For the planned features list, go to Issues.

Thank you so much for being a part of the family.

Love,
â€“Calvin & the rest of the Simplero team
